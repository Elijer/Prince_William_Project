# Animated Ambassador Outreach Ad'
An animated video designed to influence volunteers to sign up for the Prince William County Ambassador Program (PWC).

## Introduction: What is the Ambassador Program Strategy?
PWC Ambassador's will be connecting local businesses in the county with resources allotted by the CARES Act. The funds and resources available will expire in December, so the purpose of the Ambassador Program is to advertise the economic aid available to Local Businesses. Ambassadors themselves have three incentives to volunteer:

1. Interest in their communities
2. Prizes that will be available to them
3. Their Competitive Spirit

### Alternative, Future Goal for the Ambassador Outreach Ad
Although the aim of this aide is officially to encourage new volunteers to sign up for the Ambassador program, the team at 5C consulting has realized that a strategy of DIRECT outreach, especially through an Animated Ad such as this one, may be a powerful companion to, or even replacement of, the Ambassador Strategy. 

##### **Flow of information using the current Ambassador Strategy:**
`PWC  --> Ambassadors --> PWC Businesses`

##### **Flow of information using potential Direct Outreach Strategy:**
`PWC  --> PWC Businesses`

## Video Elements

### Color Scheme
A unified color scheme does wonders. If done right, it can be colorful, which attracts people to a video and keeps them their. However, if the colors are unpredictable, and too varied, it can distract from the visual information in the video. Within the elements of an animation, color can be used to prioritize attention, drawing it towards things that are important, and preventing confusion by keeping focal points unambiguous and singular.

### Branding and Font
Certain fonts are quicker and easier to read and so have faster comprehension speed and are a good fit for motion graphics and videos. Fonts also tend to signal the type of authority the video was made by. Some fonts are playful and non-authoritative, others are rigid and buerocratic. Perhaps a balance between these styles can make the message both exciting and light while also signalling, "this is legitimate news, this comes from the government, and this is important."

### Pacing
Something to keep track of, as everyone experiences a "good" video pace a little differently, especially when that video is packed with information. For the most part, this will just refer to a balance between making the most of the viewers attention while ALSO not going so fast that the viewer (who likely will be distracted, as human beings usually are) will still absorb enough of the information for it to make an impact on them. I think this idea of "impact" can be worth getting into a little bit deeper. Throwing all of the information you want a viewer to understand won't MAGICALLY make them digest it, or even care. As a result, sometimes a single line or image or idea can be more powerful than an entire script, and I think this is worth consideration.

### Visual Themes / Metaphors
Like color scheme, font, and pacing, visual themes affect how the viewer relates to the ad. Here are some examples of visual themes. Keep in mind that while these themes are not mutually exclusive, you don't want mix too many visual metaphors or it can get confusing
1. **Animals as people** (Advantages: Doesn't alienate people of age/racial/economic/etc groups who are poorly represented by characters in ad. Can add a feeling of levity to ad. Disadvantages: May cause subject matter to be recieved *too* lightly; not taken seriously)
2. **Zombie-ism as a standin for COVID** (Advantages: Exciting, encourages a "protector" role for potential ambassadors. Disadvantage: COVID survivors usually recover, while zombies usually get their heads shot off. Unnecessary focal point on sensationalism, disease, and catastrophe)
3. **Economic Recovery from COVID Difficulties as a Highway**. Description: Likening the recovery from COVID to a road you are driving on. There are obstacles like lockdowns, or staff getting sick. I'm not sure what your destination is in this metaphor...Maybe to escape COVID zombies? I keep coming back to Zombies, sorry.
4. **No Metapor.** Just tell it like it is. There are businesses, they have problems, we want to help them. There are resources for them. This doesn't run the risk of being confusing, although it does run the risk of not being engaging enough to stand out amid other PSA's and ads with similar language. Animals and zombies make my job as an animator easier, because I can create images that really bring people in. However, it is my job to do this ANYWAYS, so if a metaphor gets in the way of the clarity of the message, that's not acceptable. I just think that metaphors are worth considering because sometimes people absorb things better in that form.
