# Proposal for Scope of Work for "Animated Ambassador Outreach Ad", with Pivot Option
This is my proposal for creating an animated Ad for the purpose of advertising the existence of the PWC Ambassador Program.

</br>

## Scope of Work
* Minor Script Modifications
* Storyboarding
* Voice Over Production
* Art Direction (Color Scheme, fonts, brand consistency, and other artistic choices)
* Creation of original artwork assets (characters, settings, etc.) to be used in Animated Ad
* One Draft Render at 33% completion
* Another Draft Render at 66% completion
* One 45s - 55s render after 55 hours of work that:
  - achieves the intended purpose of introducing prospective volunteers to the PWC Ambassador program
  - includes a voice over of the agreed-upon script.
* Up to two re-renders in response to organized feedback and criticism of original video.

## Some Thoughts on the Scope

### Laying the Foundation for Future Changes
I couldn't really think of a way to include it in the description, but I wanted to say that I will do my best to organize my project files so that it is very easy to substitute and re-arrange and the content as necessary in order to change the function of the video from "Outreach to Future Ambassadors" to "Outreach Directly to Businesses". I don't think this should be a problem, and my guess is that with an additional 5 - 30 hours of work, I would be able to pivot the function of the video in this way.

In addition, things like color schemes, character creation and project structure provide a fantastic foundation for future videos with the same style and branding. My goal is for you to be satisfied with the quality of this video for the price I am offering, but I want to say that once the groundwork is laid, creating future, similiar videos will be much faster and take less labor from me.

### Notes on the Re-Render Expectations

Note on the two re-renders: This scope of work is not a contract, but I would like some protection in the contract regarding what is expected of me for the re-renders. For example, I should obviously not be expected to work another 60 hours for both re-render. I think an expectation of about 5 hours of work per render, including the time that it takes me to recieve the criticism and feedback. The 33% and 66% renders are designed to reach a consensus of expectations *before* the video is rendered, precisely so that roughly 5 hours of labor per re-render is adequate. If more renders are needed than those two, or changes that require substantially more work than 10 additional hours, those needs should be addressed with a second contract and I think it's fair to say that that additional labor should not be included within this scope of work.

Building on that, I can incorporate feedback MUCH more efficiently when it presented all at once so that I can incorporate it into a single render, rather than additional renders. Being told one change, making that change, rendering it, and then being told another change, making it, and then rendering it, is very inneffecient and not ideal for either party. When feedback is considered and presented carefully, 2 additional renders can go a really long way! I only add this note because of bad experiences I've had in the past, but this may already be familiar to you.
