# Scope of Work Proposal for "Animated Ambassador Outreach Ad", with Pivot Option
This is my proposal for creating an animated Ad for the purpose of advertising the existence of the PWC Ambassador Program. It's not a contract in itself, but can be used to write one.

</br>

## Scope of Work for this Project:
1. Minor Script Modifications
2. Storyboarding
3. Voice Over Production
4. Art Direction (Color Scheme, fonts, brand consistency, and other artistic choices)
5. Creation of original artwork assets (characters, settings, etc.) to be used in Animated Ad
6. One Draft Render at 33% completion
7. Another Draft Render at 66% completion
8. One 45s - 55s render after 55 hours of work that:
  - achieves the intended purpose of introducing prospective volunteers to the PWC Ambassador program
  - includes a voice over of the agreed-upon script.
9. Up to two re-renders in response to organized feedback and criticism of original video, which should not exceed 5 hours of labor each.

## Please suggest any desired additions or modifications if they occur to you.
This document is designed to literally get us on the same page. After talking with you and Laura, this is what I think you need from me and what I can provide for you. If there is anything missing or incorrect, please let me know.

## Some Thoughts on the Scope

### Laying the Foundation for Future Changes
Because you have made me aware of the possibility that the audience of this video may change, I will organize my project files so that it is easy to substitute and re-arrange the content as necessary. As a result, if this pivot becomes necessary, it will take a fraction of the labor.

### Notes on the Re-Render Expectations
The 33% and 66% renders are designed to reach a consensus of expectations *before* the video is rendered, precisely so that roughly 5 hours of labor per re-render is adequate. Past this amount of labor, I would like to be paid hourly. It is best for both party if feedback is given all at once in a single document or outlined clearly in a single conversation so that it can be incorporated into a subsequent render. If we work in this way, 2 renders can go a long way, especially if communication has been going well over the course of the video. In fact, I am open to sharing more status updates than the 33% and 66% renders if requested. Constant communication is good for the project. Screenshots and even renders of just one section can be helpful tools here.
