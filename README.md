# Animated Ambassador Outreach Ad'
An animated video designed to influence volunteers to sign up for the Prince William County Ambassador Program (PWC).

### What is the Ambassador Program Strategy?
PWC Ambassador's will be connecting local businesses in the county with resources allotted by the CARES Act. The funds and resources available will expire in December, so the purpose of the Ambassador Program is to advertize the economic aide available to Local Businesses. Ambassadors themselves are incentivized to volunteer by three things:

1. Interest in their communities
2. Prizes that will be available to them
3. Their Competitive Spirit

### Alternative, Future Goal for the Ambassador Outreach Ad
Although the aim of this aide is officially to encourage new volunteers to sign up for the Ambassador program, the team at 5C consulting has realized that a strategy of DIRECT outreach, especially through an Animated Ad such as this one, may be a powerful companion to, or even replacement of, the Ambassador Strategy. 

##### **Flow of information using the current Ambassador Strategy:**
`PWC  --> Ambassadors --> PWC Businesseses`

##### **Flow of information using potential Direct Outreach Strategy:**
`PWC  --> PWC Businesseses`

## Scripts

### Script #1
Do you know a business in Prince William County that has been impacted by COVID19? We have good news.

The Prince William County Economic and Development Department has recently received funds through the Cares Act to bring aid to employers that need it. Micro grants, business counseling and Personal Protective Equipment are readily available, and we need help spreading the news. 

To help get the word out about these resources, the county has developed the Ambassador’s Program.

In this program, volunteers will have the opportunity to connect with local employers to inform them of the resources that are here and readily available.

Become an ambassador and deliver great news to people who need to hear it. 

Not only will you be helping to heal your local economy; you will also be eligible to win various prizes, from iPads to fine dining.

We need your help. Become an ambassador today by contacting ____ at _____, or just click the link that’s in the bio.

`Put something here about what to do if you see this and you are a business???`

Let us recover, together.
