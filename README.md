# Animated Ambassador Outreach Ad'
An animated video designed to influence volunteers to sign up for the Prince William County Ambassador Program (PWC).

</br>

## Introduction: What is the Ambassador Program Strategy?
PWC Ambassador's will be connecting local businesses in the county with resources allotted by the CARES Act. The funds and resources available will expire in December, so the purpose of the Ambassador Program is to advertize the economic aide available to Local Businesses. Ambassadors themselves are incentivized to volunteer by three things:

1. Interest in their communities
2. Prizes that will be available to them
3. Their Competitive Spirit

### Alternative, Future Goal for the Ambassador Outreach Ad
Although the aim of this aide is officially to encourage new volunteers to sign up for the Ambassador program, the team at 5C consulting has realized that a strategy of DIRECT outreach, especially through an Animated Ad such as this one, may be a powerful companion to, or even replacement of, the Ambassador Strategy. 

##### **Flow of information using the current Ambassador Strategy:**
`PWC  --> Ambassadors --> PWC Businesseses`

##### **Flow of information using potential Direct Outreach Strategy:**
`PWC  --> PWC Businesseses`
